# Ideas

- Fade out editor window when idle
- Show commented drum beats/etc. highlighted as time passes  "0xx00xx"
- Switch in new state at beginning of a bar, phrase, etc.
- User can immediately compile, auto compile, at next phrase
- Show extra data as added comments

# Release Checks

- [] Notepad mode by default
- [] Package and reload a standard setup
- [] Low and Hi Res displays
- [] Notepad mode abilities: split, close, etc.  User test.
- [] Initial window sizes/shapes
